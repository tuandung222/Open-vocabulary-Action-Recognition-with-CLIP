# Beginner Guides for CLIP HAR Project

Welcome to the beginner guides for the CLIP HAR (Human Action Recognition) project! This collection of guides is designed to help newcomers understand the various technologies, concepts, and approaches used in this project.

## Purpose

The CLIP HAR project combines multiple advanced technologies and concepts that might be challenging for beginners. These guides aim to:

1. Explain complex concepts in simple terms
2. Provide step-by-step instructions for common tasks
3. Offer practical examples for hands-on learning
4. Bridge the gap between theory and implementation
